  await notifyPuzzleRelease(allUsers.map(u => u.id), {
    puzzleId: puzzle.id,
    puzzleTitle: puzzle.title,
    difficulty: puzzle.difficulty || "MEDIUM",
    points: pointsReward || 100,

  leaderboard.sort((a, b) => b.totalPoints - a.totalPoints);
  const currentRank = leaderboard.findIndex(e => e.userId === user.id) + 1;
  
  // Only notify if rank improved significantly
  if (currentRank <= 100 && currentRank < previousRank) {
    await notifyLeaderboardChange(user.id, {

## 💡 Implementation Highlights

### Smart Achievement Logic
```typescript
// Checks if user actually earned achievement
// Only awards if condition met
// Auto-detects "First Puzzle" achievement
if (achievement.name === "First Puzzle") {
  const solvedCount = await prisma.userPuzzleProgress.count(
    where: { userId, solved: true }
  );
  shouldUnlock = solvedCount === 1;
}
```

### Leaderboard Rank Tracking
```typescript
// Calculates full leaderboard on puzzle solve
// Determines exact rank
// Only notifies if rank improved
// Only if in top 100
```

### Team Member Notifications
```typescript
// Notifies ALL team members of new join
// Gets their names automatically
// Includes in update message
// Respects preferences
```
