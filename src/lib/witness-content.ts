    report: `Subject: Marcus Holt, 38, male.

Holt arrived at the Ashwood Hotel at approximately 21:15 using a key card registered under the name "Elena Voss." He was observed by the night concierge carrying a brown leather briefcase and a grey umbrella. He proceeded directly to the elevator and ascended to the seventh floor.

At 23:30, hotel security received a noise complaint from room 714. Upon arriving within four minutes, officers found the room vacant. The window was unlatched. The leather briefcase remained on the bed — empty. A single playing card, the eight of clubs, had been left face-up on the pillow.

Hotel CCTV captured a woman in a red coat exiting through the service entrance at 23:18 — twelve minutes before the complaint was filed. No guests reported hearing an argument. The room had been booked for three nights under a corporate card.

No sign of forced entry. No blood. No note.`,

    report: `Subject: Unnamed courier, female, approximately 30 years old.

At 06:50, transit police responded to platform 9 at Central Station following reports of an unattended bag. The bag — a black canvas duffel — was found on the third bench from the northern entrance. A folded newspaper from two days prior was on top of the bag. Inside: three sealed envelopes addressed to different cities (Lyon, Oslo, and Reykjavik), a burner phone with a single sent message reading "it's done," and a pair of latex gloves still in their packaging.

Platform CCTV showed a woman in a yellow rain jacket leaving the duffel at 06:44 and exiting through turnstile 7. She paused briefly at a vending machine, purchasing nothing, and then disappeared into the westbound tunnel.

A transit worker confirmed the bag had not been there at 06:30 during his sweep. The phone was registered to no one. The envelopes contained only blank paper. Forensics found no prints.`,

    report: `Subject: Dr. Irene Calloway, 52, professor of applied mathematics.

Calloway failed to appear for a scheduled 14:00 department meeting at Whitmore University. Her office on the fourth floor of the Hargreaves Building was found unlocked. Her laptop was open to a partially written email addressed to a "V. Renko" — the body read only: "They know. Burn the Linz files before—". The email was never sent.

A half-eaten sandwich and an untouched cup of coffee still warm to the touch indicated a recent departure. Her phone, wallet, and car keys were on her desk. The window overlooking the east courtyard was open six inches.

A junior colleague reported hearing raised voices from the corridor at approximately 13:45. A visitor's badge, issued at 13:31 for a "Dr. P. Marsh," was recovered near the stairwell. University records show no scheduled visit from any Dr. Marsh. Campus CCTV failed for the Hargreaves wing between 13:30 and 15:00 due to a network fault.`,
